# File-Access-System
Its a basic implementation of lock table maintained by Database Management Systems (DBMS) in the backend using Hash Tables and Priority Queues.
So, all users can read file simultaneously, but, when a user has to write on a file, then he should have exculsive access to file and no other user can access that file untill the writer is not done with it.
It actually implements the functionality of reader and writer locks discussed in Operating Systems (OS).
